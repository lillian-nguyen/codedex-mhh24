# 2024 Codédex Mini Holiday Hackathon Submission
The theme was 90s retro aesthetics; I chose the 'now it's personal route'
The Hero's Journey is a mini digital sanctuary inspired by classic role-playing games. This project is my tribute to the immersive worlds, pixelated heroes, and plot. I also incorporated therapeutic elements like a greenhouse where you can listen to some tracks and a 'scream into the void feature' where you can vent something by screaming at the edge of a cliff (because we've all had those days).

A live demo can be found [here](https://herosjourney.netlify.app/).

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

## Optimizations: 
With more time, I would address: 
<li>Responsiveness across devices</li>
<li>Clearing out the input for cliff reset button</li>

## Lessons Learned:

This is my second hackathon; the environment continues to be both humbling and motivating. These events capture the essence of community and continuous learning, especially in spite of the many unknowns. Everything is "figure-outable", and I'm carrying this mindset into the hackathon space of organized chaos! Other project takeaways include: 

**Time management**: I had a lot of ideas and had to narrow down which features to prioritize. The end product didn't always reflect what I envisioned, but I learned to give myself grace and still appreciate how much I learned in such a short time! Done is better than perfect, but it's highly advised to have a plan.

**Organization**: I felt confident about this at first, but hackathon brain is a different beast! Hoarding and sifting through the gifs and images I collected for the project was a major pain in the assets..

**The power of community**: This was a solo hackathon, but I was lucky to have a coding buddy! It made it easier to navigate the stress and late night work sessions; I'm convinced this might be the secret sauce! Thank you to the Codédex community and staff for the support and wholesome vibes, too!
